<h3>üßë‚Äçüíª How I Became a Developer</h3>


---------------------
<h3>üêç My Developer Identity</h3>

### I studied **Full Stack Development** at Code Fellows but I have really found true love in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**.  I am attracted to the suggestions and facts that can be scientifically deduced from data. Gathering, manipulating and learning from data was part of my previous career and felt like a natural avenue in software development. 

  - ### üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies and Tools**

    - **OS** : macOS Catalina, Microsoft Windows
    - **Editor** : Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook
    - **Languages** : Python, SQL, JavaScript(ES6), jQuery, CSS, HTML, Markdown
    - **Frameworks/Layouts/Templates** : Django (REST), PyTest, EJS, Express.js, SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS), CSS Flexbox & Grid
    - **Libraries/Tools** : React, Whitenoise, JSON Web Tokens, Docker, Selenium with Python, Beautiful Soup, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Pip, Poetry, Heroku, Git, Chrome DevTools, Regex, npm, Node.js, Chart.js
